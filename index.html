When it comes to human space exploration, space weather is something that has the potential to be hugely detrimental to some of the simplest missions.
This article will not only explain what space weather is but also what different types of space weather there are, and how each of the different
types create new and unique problems. By collecting research from multiple different sources, this article explains the approach many different
space agencies take to combat these problems and discusses how effective they are.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
Human spaceflight and exploration are important for many reasons, with one of the most notable being to help with new discoveries and findings
that can advance science on Earth to help many people across the globe. However, one of the most dangerous and vital factors that must be considered
in space exploration is space weather. Taking it into consideration can be the difference between a successful mission or a disaster.

<h3 id="Different Types of Space Weather">Different Types of Space Weather</h3>
 <p class="ex1">
   <pre>
There are many different types of space weather that can detrimentally affect a mission, such as solar flares, CME’s and geomagnetic storms.
Solar flares are tremendous explosions on the surface of the Sun, releasing energy which travels at the speed of light. CME’s stand
for Coronal Mass Ejections, which are large clouds of solar plasma and embedded magnetic fields. They can enlarge to millions of kilometres
across, which can cause huge problems not only for astronauts in orbit but also minor problems for a planet like Earth. A geomagnetic storm
is a significant disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field caused by events such as solar flares or CME’s. These storms result from variations
in solar wind close to Earth’s atmosphere that produce major changes in the currents, plasmas and fields in Earth’s magnetosphere.

  <p class="ex1">

Although it is important to know how different types of space weather form, it is just as important to know how it can affect astronauts, spacecraft
and operations in space. The effects on astronauts in orbit are all relatively similar but the effects vary on spacecraft and other operations
during spaceflight. Both solar flares and CME’s involve high energy particles travelling at the speed of light, which presents extreme problems
to unshielded astronauts. A small amount of exposure would cause radiation poisoning, and a lot of exposure could prove fatal (Byrd, 2020). Solar
activity is also dangerous for spaceflight because it can cause problems with equipment vital to a mission, such as satellites and the spacecraft
itself. The high energy particles emitted by solar flares and CME’s can fry sensitive microchips, and damage electronics and solar panels, which
could be very dangerous for vital life support systems on spacecraft, such as the International Space Station for example (HT Tech, 2023). Below
is a table outlining the different impacts that different space weather events can have on electronics that could prove vital to a mission.

   <p class="ex1">
     <pre>
Some examples of times where space weather has caused problems for not only spacecraft, but for communications systems on Earth are the “Haunting
Halloween storms of 2003” and more recently, some very costly geomagnetic storms in February 2022. The 2003 Halloween storms consisted of
extremely powerful solar flares and CME’s that hit Earth’s atmosphere. According to Tariq Malek’s article on ‘the worst solar storms in
history’ (2022), the storms caused multiple problems with satellite systems, and other problems like power outages and forcing aircraft to
re-route. The geomagnetic storms from 2022 caused tens of millions of dollars of “SpaceX” satellites to be destroyed, due to the storms
increasing the density of parts of Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in the satellites’ destruction before they could reach the higher part of
Earth’s atmosphere (Dang T. et al.  2022).

As we know, Earth’s atmosphere protects us from most space weather and radiation, however in space, astronauts need other forms of protection.
As of right now, the main countermeasure against (specifically space radiation) is straightforward. Space agencies simply just limit the
amount of time astronauts are allowed to be in space. For example, this is done by reducing the overall mission duration on the ISS to 3-6
months, shortening the time spent on spacewalks and planning missions during times of low solar activity according to a publication written
by NASA (Rask J et al. 2012). Agencies also use more physical methods of radiation protection as well. Once again, on the ISS, the shielding
used is a hydrogen-rich shielding called polyethylene, most used on locations aboard the station that are used the most, e.g. living spaces.
These examples of radiation protection are vital to continuing space exploration in the future.

*However, at 12km altitude, above most of Earth's atmosphere, the average radiation per year rises to 20 mSv at the equator, and 50-120 mSv at
 the poles ('Health threat from cosmic rays', 2023)

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
   <p class="ex1">
     <pre>
While many space agencies have developed many effective responses to space weather and the challenges that come with it, there is always more
work to be done. More understanding of space weather and how to counteract could lead to important new discoveries and even further exploration in the future.
